# Pablo's Pizza Backend Test Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite verifies the fixes for two critical issues:

1. **Dashboard Revenue Calculation**: Confirms that revenue is correctly calculated from confirmed bookings, including future events and the specific $193,000 October 2025 booking.

2. **Chat CORS Functionality**: Validates that the `/api/chat/rooms` endpoint works correctly with CORS headers and the `active_only` parameter.

## Quick Start

### Run Demo Tests
```bash
cd backend
python quick_test_demo.py
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Install Test Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-mock
```

## Key Test Scenarios Verified

### âœ… Dashboard Revenue Tests
- **$193,000 Booking**: Specifically tests the October 2025 confirmed booking
- **Status Filtering**: Only confirmed bookings count toward revenue
- **Future Events**: Future confirmed events are included in revenue calculations
- **Pricing Logic**: Workshop and pizza party pricing with bulk discounts
- **Performance**: Handles large datasets efficiently

### âœ… Chat CORS Tests
- **CORS Headers**: All endpoints return proper `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
- **active_only Parameter**: Correctly filters active vs closed chat rooms
- **Error Handling**: CORS headers present even in error responses
- **Data Structure**: API responses match frontend expectations
- **Preflight Requests**: OPTIONS requests work correctly

## What These Tests Prove

### Dashboard Revenue Calculation âœ…
- Events with status 'confirmed' are included in revenue calculation
- Future confirmed events (beyond current month) are included
- The $193,000 booking is correctly handled
- Monthly events vs confirmed revenue logic works properly
- Pending/cancelled bookings are excluded from revenue

### Chat CORS Functionality âœ…
- `/api/chat/rooms` endpoint works with `active_only` parameter
- CORS headers are present in all responses
- Data structure matches frontend expectations
- Error handling maintains CORS compatibility
- Performance is acceptable with large datasets

## Running Specific Tests

### Revenue Calculation Tests Only
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_revenue_calculation.py -v
```

### Dashboard Integration Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_dashboard_revenue.py -v
```

### Chat CORS Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_chat_cors.py -v
```

### Specific Test Method
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_revenue_calculation.py::TestRevenueCalculation::test_193k_booking_scenario -v
```

## Mock Data Used

The tests use comprehensive mock data including:

- **$193k Corporate Booking**: 143 participants, workshop type, October 2025, confirmed status
- **Future Bookings**: Various confirmed and pending bookings in different months
- **Chat Rooms**: Active and closed chat rooms with different statuses
- **Mixed Status Bookings**: To test filtering logic

## Dependencies

- **pytest**: Test framework
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking support
- **unittest.mock**: Python's built-in mocking (included)

All external dependencies (Firebase, email, etc.) are mocked, so no real connections are needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import Errors**: Make sure you're running from the `backend/` directory
- **Missing pytest**: Run `pip install pytest pytest-mock`
- **Path Issues**: Tests automatically adjust Python path

### If Tests Fail
1. Check the specific error message
2. Ensure mock data structure matches expectations
3. Verify CORS configuration allows all origins
4. Check booking status filtering logic
